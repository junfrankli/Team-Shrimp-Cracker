# Meeting Notes

## Meeting 1:

### September 8th

#### 3D Printing
Since the current model of the robot provided to us did not meet our expectations (the choices for sensor locations are limited on the pre-drilled board), we would like to try 3d printing for personalized design.

#### Prelab Meet
Meet next Wednesday, Sep. 13, at 6:30 to check on the prelab to make sure everyone understands the code and the flow of lab2.

#### Contract
Contract will be updated according to the feedback.

 
 
## Meeting 2:

### September 15th

#### Tasks
Assign tasks of lab2 to every group member and make sure the workload of each member is similar.

#### Data
Upload all the codes, pictures, and videos to group's Google Drive and make sure the documents are enough for all the sections of lab2.

#### Open Lab Meetup
Scheduled to meet on open lab during 6:30-8:30 on Wednesday, Sep. 19, to work on lab2 and milestone1.
 
 

## Meeting 3:

### September 22th

#### Milestone 2
Check the progress on milestone2. The wall detection is working fine and the treasure detection for 7 kHz, 12kHz, and 17 kHz is almost done.

#### 3D Printing
The 3D printing is almost done and should be coming to the stage at next lab time. At that time, some alternations are needed for the synchronization of our new robot to the requirements of the course.
