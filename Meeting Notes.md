# Meeting Notes

## Meeting 1:

### September 8th

#### 3D Printing
Since the current model of the robot provided to us did not meet our expectations (the choices for sensor locations are limited on the pre-drilled board), we would like to try 3d printing for personalized design.

#### Prelab Meet
Meet next Wednesday, Sep. 13, at 6:30 to check on the prelab to make sure everyone understands the code and the flow of lab2.

#### Contract
Contract will be updated according to the feedback.



## Meeting 2:

### September 15th

#### Tasks
Assign tasks of lab2 to every group member and make sure the workload of each member is similar.

#### Data
Upload all the codes, pictures, and videos to group's Google Drive and make sure the documents are enough for all the sections of lab2.

#### Open Lab Meetup
Scheduled to meet on open lab during 6:30-8:30 on Wednesday, Sep. 19, to work on lab2 and milestone1.
